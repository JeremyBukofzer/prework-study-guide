# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description 

This webpage was designed to be an study guide for the basic introduction to writing code. This project was built to introduce bootcamp students into the world of coding. It provides answers to the basic understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. I learned that HTML is the framework of a code, CSS is the design of code, and JavaScript is the function of code.
